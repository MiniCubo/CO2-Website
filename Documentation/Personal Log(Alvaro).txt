I investigated the Tomtom's APIs to see if the project is possible. It is feasible and it is just pending reading the doc of the APIs.

October 10th 2024

I am just making the express server translation of the web page.

I investigated a bit more on the Tomtom and Here APIs and made the conclusion that these do not serve the purpose we were hoping to use them for. I am going to talk to the team
and the teacher if we are going to discard this idea and just focus on the timelapse map.

At the end I will try to use the Openlayers services to display the map and use geojsons to show each state. Now it it just a matter of
getting the geojsons of the states.

Finally found the geojsons and added the map with the overlay to the webpage.

October 25th 2024

I am making changes to the way we obtain the info of each state in the corresponding year in the main.js. Also made the centering of states
and the change of years.
