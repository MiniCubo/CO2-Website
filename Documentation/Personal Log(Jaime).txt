It has been a difficult project, mainly because of the overlay on our web app to show the mexican map, it caused lot of
trouble, we have been working independently most of the midterm but yesterday, 26th octuber, we stayed at Soto´s house
to work on the project, in one afternoon we made a lot of progress mainly because we were researching and coding together,
when someone had a mistake or someone was tired of watching tutorials on youtube the other ones could detect the mistake,
give fresh ideas and take turns to work.

To be honest its been a difficult midterm for me, I´ve been strugling with personal difficulties so i havent worked on
the project that much, my role is mostly support Soto and Samuel to look for solutions and signalize errors while they
are coding, when we gather up to work in group I search for details that can be upgraded, quality life improvements and 
design choices.

React is breaking my head, I feel completely lost on how to connect everythng together, most of the general structure has
been made by Samuel and page structure by Soto, our main difficulty is open layers, that keeps trhowing error and
stops working if we change even the smalles part of the code that handles it.

Almost everything is done, we just need to finish the documentation like this log, presentation and design document.
Its been a long semester.
